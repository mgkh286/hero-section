## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.nav {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  border-top: 1px solid hsl(215, 32%, 27%);
  padding: 0.7rem 0;
  gap: 15px;
}
```




### Continued development

i will continue focusing on using flexbox in future projects. 


### Useful resources

- [Mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - This helped me for using flexbox. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [ resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_flex-basis.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS flex-basis Property. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
